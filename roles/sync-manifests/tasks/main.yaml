# The role is used to copy manifest directory to remote host
# Durning tests in zuul, zuul copies git repository to target node, however
# When running outside zuul/opendev ci env, we want to copy manifests from
# commit to remote machine as well. `local_src_dir` should be set from command
# line in anisble-playbook -e option,
# eg: ansible-playbook -e local_src_dir="/home/ubuntu/airshipctl"
